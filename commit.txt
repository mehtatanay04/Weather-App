Add weather-based backgrounds, default dark mode, AQI labels, and black text for city/date in light mode

- Implemented dynamic weather-based background gradients for both dark and light modes, with distinct palettes for sunny, rainy, cloudy, and night conditions.
- Set dark mode as the default theme, with user preference saved in localStorage.
- Enhanced AQI display to show descriptive labels (e.g., "Good", "Moderate") instead of raw indices, with proper color coding and null handling.
- Changed city and date text color to black in light mode for improved readability.
- Improved gradient animations and color vibrancy for better visual distinction.
- Added console logging for background debugging and ensured offline cached data support.
- Maintained existing features (unit toggle, alerts, map, favorites, recent searches) with no regressions.
